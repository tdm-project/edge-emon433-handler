# edge-emon433-handler

## Edge handler for Open Energy Monitor devices

To install on Edge device it is necessary to configure the serial port on raspberry pi 3 as described in  https://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/ :

Therefore:
```bash
$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
and add the lines (at the bottom):

```
core_freq=250
enable_uart=1
```

You also need to remove the console from the cmdline.txt. If you edit this with:

```bash
$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```

you will see something like:

```
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes root wait
```

remove the line: console=serial0,115200 and save and reboot for changes to take effect.

To check serial communication through GPIO:

```bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyS0 -b 38400
```

It a pacman -Syu is run an additiona service is added that may ruin the routing, therefore:

```bash
systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
```

Container is run like this:

```bash
docker run -it --privileged --network tdm_edge tdmproject/edge-emon433-handler
```
